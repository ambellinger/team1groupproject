1) All of us are busy these days - whether with school, kids, work, endless projects, or all of the above! Some of also don’t know how to cook, or we want to create the next culinary masterpiece.

Let’s CookIt! allows us to search recipes without having to go to a million different websites. You can read or watch your recipe in one place and add to a handy to-do list that will help you achieve your foodie goals!

2) We used the edamam and the youtube api. The technologies we used jQuery bootstrap, Sass, bootstrap, Font Awesome, and Firebase

3) Some of the challenges we experienced were trying to find a free recipes API that provided everything we needed. In addition to that, we had difficulty working with GitHub.

4) In the future, we would like to create user account/login, have another API that will suggest stores where to buy groceries or utilize amazon, have a random recipe button, a favorite meal section, a sharing option (FB, Pinterest, etc.), animated front end, featured & recommended recipes on the landing page, etc.
